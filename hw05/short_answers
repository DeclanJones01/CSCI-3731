1 What is the problem with two-dimensional arrays in C/C++?
The problems come when you try to pass a two dimensional array to a function. If a function
takes a two dimensional array as an argument, you have to specify the dimensions of that array at compile time. So you could write a program that would handle images with 640 × 480 pixels, but
that same program could not handle images of any other size.


2 Describe two ways to work around C/C++’s problems with two dimensional arrays.
The two ways are to use flat arrays, where store your data in a one dimensional array with the rows laid
end to end, and using two arrays: a flat array and an array of pointers.

3 Suppose you have a function that returns a two dimensional array of ints allocated using
the “Numerical Recipes trick”. The caller should not be able to modify the values stored in
this array or the pointers to rows. The function declaration looks like this:
___________________________ getArray();
Fill in the blank.

const* int getArray();
