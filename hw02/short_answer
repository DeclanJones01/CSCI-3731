2. What is the difference between a function declaration and a function definition?
	Declare a function to tell the compiler that it exists and describe its arguments and return type.
	Then elsewhere in the code you define the function by providing the code it executes.
3. Why does C/C++ need to have function declarations? Why doesnâ€™t Java have them?
	The C/C++ compiler makes one pass through the code, while the Java
	compiler makes two.
4. What is the C preprocessor, and what does it do?
	A separate program that does simple text manipulations, based on directives
	that all begin with #.
5. What do you use header files for?
	Header files include declarations so you don't have to declare multiple functions across different files.
8. Suppose you have the following:
#define MAX_VALUE 32767
Is MAX VALUE a variable? If not, what is it?
	MAX_VALUE is not a variable but it is a preprocessor macro.
