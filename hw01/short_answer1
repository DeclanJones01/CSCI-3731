2.1 Why would it be a bad idea to enter the following bash commands?

cd
rm -r*

cd will go to home directory and rm -r* will delete all files with no warning.

2.3 What is the difference between compiling and linking?

Compiling reads your code file and generates an object file. Linking connects all object files to produce an executable.

2.9 Would the following code compile in C++? Why or why not?

double x=32.0;
int n=x;

Yes, the code will compile but because x is a double and n is an int the values after the decimal will be cut off.

2.10 What is wrong with the following code, and how would you fix it?

int sum;
for(int i=0; i<1000; ++i)
{
sum +=i;
}
printf("Sum of 0 to 999 is %d\n", sum);

int sum is not initialized, I would initialize sum to 0. I would also rewrite ++i as i++.
