 1. What is a pointer? What is the closest thing to a pointer in Java?
 
 They give you direct access to your computer’s memory. Pointers can allow you to return multiple variables in a function. The closest thing in java is a primitive value.
 
 9. Describe what each of the following declare:
(a) int* a;
A variable, a, that if you dereference it, is an int.

(b) const int b;
An int b with a const value that won't let you change it.

(c) const int* c;
This is a const pointer to a const int. You can’t modify the pointer or the data it points to.

(d) int* const d;
This is a const pointer to a non-const int. You can modify the data it points to but not the pointer.

(e) const int* const e;
This declares a const pointer to a const int.


12. This code computes both the square and cube of a number. What is wrong with it and, how would you fix it?
double* powers(double x, double* x3_ptr) {
double x2 = x*x;
*x3_ptr = x2*x;
return &x2;
}

The function should be just "double" instead of "double*". Only x2 is returned so unless you didn't need x3 you 
should also return x3 but you also don't need to return when you use pointers because the whole point is that they point to the memory location.
If you wanted to reference the variables you could use &x2 in a print line.

14. Sometimes when you call this function, you get a seg fault. In what line is the seg fault occurring?
void twitchy(int in, int* out) {
int sum = 0;
for(int i=0; i<n; ++i) {
if(i%2) sum + 5;
else sum /= 2;
}
*out = sum;
}

The fault is in the line *out because outside of the loop sum =0.

15. 15. The following code does not compile. What is wrong and how would you fix it?
int n = -1;
scanf("%d", n);

Instead of n you need to put &n for the memory location of n.
